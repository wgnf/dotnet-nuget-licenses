**liz** (Ààl…™z - like the nickname for a person named "Elizabeth") is a tool to extract license-information from your project/solution aimed on a **fast** and **correct** process. Whether it's via a dotnet-CLI-Tool, Cake-Addin or Nuke-Addon.

## üåê Features

**liz** currently supports the following features:

- Determining all (also with transitive if desired) dependencies for the given solution/project for SDK-style and non-SDK-style projects
- Extract license information (type, URL, text) from all currently known sources for these dependencies
- Print the found dependencies including their license information to the console/log
- Print the problems that occured during the process (missing license-information) to the console/log
- (Try to) determine the license-type from the license-text, if no license-type could be determined
- (Try to) determine the license-type from the license-url, if no license-type could be determined
- Validate the determined package-references and their license-types against a provided whitelist/blacklist
- Export license-information in various forms:
  - license-texts into text-files in a given directory

### Planned features

- [#11](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/11) & [#12](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/12) Mapping from package-reference to license-information
- [#16](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/16) Export license-information in various forms to a given directory/file
- [#5](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/5) & [#7](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/7) Filter for projects and dependencies
- [#6](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/6) Ability to provide manual dependencies
- [#1](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/1) Caching for even faster analyzation times
- [#28](https://github.com/wgnf/liz/issues/28) Sanitize HTML-Tags

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### SDK-Style projects

Analyzing SDK-Style projects at least requires:

- .NET Core SDK **2.2** (for the `dotnet` CLI)
  - Get it here:
    - [Official Website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/2.2)
    - [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetcore-2.2-sdk)
- It has to be globally available through the command line (verify with `dotnet --version`)

### Non-SDK-Style projects

Analyzing Non-SDK-Style projects at least requires:

- NuGet CLI (aka `nuget.exe`) **2.7**
  - Get it here:
    - [Official Website](https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
    - [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/NuGet.CommandLine)
- It has to be globally available through the command line (verify with `nuget help`)

## ‚å®Ô∏è Developing

To develop and work with **liz** you just need to clone this Repo somewhere on your PC and then open the Solution or the complete Source-Folder (under `src`) with your favorite IDE. No additional tools required.  
  
Before you can start, you should restore all NuGet-Packages using `dotnet restore` if that's not done for you by your IDE.  
  
As this uses .NET 6.0, you need to install the .NET 6.0.x SDK (as configured by the `global.json`).
