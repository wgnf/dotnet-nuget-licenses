## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### SDK-Style projects

Analyzing SDK-Style projects at least requires:

- .NET Core SDK **2.2** (for the `dotnet` CLI)
  - Get it here:
    - [Official Website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/2.2)
    - [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/dotnetcore-2.2-sdk)
- It has to be globally available through the command line (verify with `dotnet --version`)

### Non-SDK-Style projects

Analyzing Non-SDK-Style projects at least requires:

- NuGet CLI (aka `nuget.exe`) **2.7**
  - Get it here:
    - [Official Website](https://www.nuget.org/downloads)
    - [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/NuGet.CommandLine)
- It has to be globally available through the command line (verify with `nuget help`)

## ‚å®Ô∏è Developing

To develop and work with **liz** you just need to clone this Repo somewhere on your PC and then open the Solution or the complete Source-Folder (under `src`) with your favorite IDE. No additional tools required.  
  
Before you can start, you should restore all NuGet-Packages using `dotnet restore` if that's not done for you by your IDE.  
  
As this uses .NET 6.0, you need to install the .NET 6.0.102 SDK (as configured by the `global.json`).

## üëã Want to Contribute?

**DISCLAIMER**  
As this is in really early development, I'd not recommend you contributing yet, because we have to figure stuff out on our own at the moment. (Code-) Structure and processes might change drastically over that time.  
  
Cool! We're always welcoming anyone that wants to contribute to this project! Take a look at the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), which helps you get started.
