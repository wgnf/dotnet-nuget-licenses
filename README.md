## ‚å®Ô∏è Developing

To develop and work with **dotnet-nuget-licenses** you just need to clone this Repo somewhere on your PC and then open the Solution or the complete Source-Folder (under `src`) with your favorite IDE. No additional tools required.  
  
Before you can start, you should restore all NuGet-Packages using `dotnet restore` if that's not done for you by your IDE.  
  
As this uses .NET 6.0, you need to install the .NET 6.0 SDK
